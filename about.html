			If you have a good enough ear to identify what you’re hearing, and you know how to map the musical combinations and sequences onto letters, then that’s all you need to be fluent in the language. But the catch is, I’m not actually going to explain how the code works here — you have to figure it out.* Once you learn it though, it’s pretty fun:

			Depending on how much of a nerd you are, you either think I’m extremely cool or extremely uncool right now. I’m not really sure what, if any, use there is for this beyond a fairly fun party trick (at what would have to be a fairly dull party).** Regardless, I’m pretty psyched about it, and I hope you enjoy playing around with it.

			Have fun!

			**Some other possible uses off the top of my head:
			<ul style="font-size:small">
				<li>Musically-inclined third-base coaches using pianos to give "steal" signs to musically-inclined baserunners</li>
				<li>Translating your favorite songs into gibberish</li>
				<li>An easy way to cheat at any number of guessing games</li>
				<li>Blow off steam by saying really mean things to people but having it sound like a mediocre piece of classical music</li>
				<li>Definitely could be used for a cool twist in a movie</li>
